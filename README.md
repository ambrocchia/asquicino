You should be able to access the following pages after starting the
development server with:

$ python manage.py runserver

by pointing your browser to:

http://localhost:8000/admin/
http://localhost:8000/polls/
http://localhost:8000/polls/1/
http://localhost:8000/polls/2/

and by following the links. You will get an error page for 

http://localhost:8000/

because no default page has been defined.

For the admin:
username: rc
password: demo
